// Find the nearest workspace, based on search around cwd and env vars.
//
// The string returned is a path to a directory that contains an '.ipld' directory.
// (E.g. the string returned does not include the '.ipld' segment itself.)
//
// The search operations, in order, are:
//
//   - accept an env var overriding it: `$IPLDTOOL_WORKSPACE`.
//   - look at the present dir so see if it contains an `.ipld` dir.
//   - look at parent dirs, recursively, to see if it contains an `.ipld` dir.
//   - if nothing is found yet: if `$IPLDTOOL_NOHOME` is set, stop, none found.
//     (Necessary to have an option for this so we can handle readonly fs without a fuss.)
//   - fallback to `$HOME/.ipld` as a workspace (even if we have to create it).
//
// Edge cases: if the '.ipld' path exists, but is a file, we don't comment on it.
// (You should get errors from subsequent operations that are informative enough anyway.)
// If we fell back to an '.ipld' dir in the user homedir, this function may create it.

//   - ipldtool-error-no-cwd -- if the cwd can't be found!
