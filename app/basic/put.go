// Storage configuration: still in debate, but I think I'd like storage config to look roughly like this:
/*

type StorageConfig [ModedStorageSpec]

type ModedStorageSpec union {
	| "rw:" StorageModeReadWrite
	| "ro:" StorageModeReadOnly
	| "wb:" StorageModeWriteBack
} representation stringprefix

type StorageModeReadWrite StorageSpec
type StorageModeReadOnly StorageSpec
type StorageModeWriteBack StorageSpec

type StorageSpec struct {
	engine string
	param string
} representation stringjoin (":")

// And so when taking a real system we know and looking at how that would be stated as a CLI flag:
// `--storage=rw:flatfs:/path:/repo/flatfs/shard/v1/next-to-last/3`
// (I can't say I care for half (or even two thirds) of the redundancy in that last hunk, but that's what flatfs does right now.  (Maybe we should tersen it up in our user-facing porcelain.))
// That flag would also be allowed repeatedly.

// Is this sufficiently ghastly that we should just force you to have a config file, and maybe make subcommands to help you set it up?
//  Well, it's dang close.
//  But I still want to be able to choose the modes per-command.  And that's easiest if it's controlled by flags or env vars.

// Perhaps a mid-way approach:
// You can have *no* config options in the CLI -- and make those a stateful part of the storage.
// The only parameter left is the storage root path.
// There are then also commands that can pre-establish a storage and configure it with options.  But this is optional.
// And that's it.
// This seems probably good.
